## Coding Standards

Make sure you follow the correct coding standards, makes our code more readable.

  - We indent using four spaces (use spacebar).
  - Namespaces needs an empty line before and after its declaration.
  - All classes have to start with a capital letter and followed by lower case characters, never use `_`.
  - The code in each function or class function the exponents need to stay on the same line as an if, foreach, and other statements.
  - You always declare public class variables first then private and then protected and then the same thing with functions.
  - After declaration of a function you need to put the exponents on a new line.  
  - After declaration of a class you need to put the exponents on a new line.
  - No extra whitespaces are not allowed.
